### What I learned

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 300px) {
    .card  :last-child {
        font-size: 0.7em;
    }
    
}
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
    .card-wrapper {
        width: 30vw;
    }
}
@media screen and (min-width: 1000px) {
    .card-wrapper {
        width: 20vw;
    }
}
```
